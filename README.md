# jpeg_image_compression
A modified version of the JPEG image compression algorithm. JPEG is a lossy image compression algorith, that relies on a frequency domain transform called Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT). By reducing or removing high-frequency information, the image can be represented using a significantly smaller number of elements.
